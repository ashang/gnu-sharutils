        * uudecode.c (O_BINARY): Define for all platforms.
        (decode): Always open with binary, where it matters.
        * uuencode.c [__CYGWIN__]: Include io.h for setmode.
        (O_BINARY): Define for all platforms.
        (main): Always open with binary, where it matters.
        (main) [__CYGWIN__]: Use setmode to make stdin binary.

2005-11-06  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* src/shar.c(echo_status): new - report status in consistent fashion.
	(throughout): remove many strings to scripts.def file.
	* src/scripts.def: add many new entries and alphabetize
	* tests/shar-1.ok: adjust to changes
	* tests/Makefile.am: add 'shar-3' test and a clean rule
	* tests/shar-3: new - test large multi part archive
	* tests/shar-1: delete varying text, not arbitrary lines from sample
	* tests/shar-2: remove unnecessary line removal

2005-09-09  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* doc/Makefile.am(dist_man5_MANS): new value.  Don't put man5 pages into
	man1 make variables.  :-}

2005-09-08  John T. Rose  <rose@iastate.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am(compress-link): install hooks need to use $(DESTDIR)

2005-09-03  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* BACKLOG: this is too old for being of much use.  Removed.
	= Released 4.5.2 to alpha.gnu.org

2005-08-30  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* shar-2 (UNSHAR): Define and use.
	* unshar.c (main): Use current arg in final loop.

2005-08-28  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* src/mail-files.in(usage): make a function and doc the positional
	command operands.
	* doc/: put "BUG REPORTS" section into man pages

2005-08-18  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* lib/system.h(intmax_t): Make sure we have this typedef
	* lib/inttostr.h(intmax_t): Make sure we don't have two copies

2005-08-15  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	* doc/sharutils.texi:
	- change main @direntry to make it align with others in the Texinfo
	   dir-example file (and be more descriptive).
	- legally it's necessary to write out the years in the copyright
	   statement, not use a macro.
	- use @insertcopying in @title so years are listed only once.
	- Texinfo has had the @, command for a cedilla accent for years, so
	   replace \ptexc hack for Francois's name.

2005-08-13  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* bootstrap: generate scripts.x
	* src/scripts.def: define several script strings that are cumbersome
	to read/write/maintain in compilable string form.  Include in this
	a new fragment that determines how to run "md5sum".
	* src/scripts.tpl: describes the transform from normal script format
	into the compilable strings
	* src/Makefile.am: distribute the scripts.* files
	* src/shar.c: #include "scripts.x".  Remove several strings to
	scripts.def.  Emit the md5sum checks in a way that works with more
	than one very ancient version of it.  Do not fill file name buffer
	past the end of the buffer.
	* tests/shar-1: No need to remove static date from "touch" line
	* tests/shar-1.ok: adjust for new md5 sum stuff.
	* tests/shar-2: adjust "sed" so it produces usable shar archive
	* tests/shar-2.ok: adjust for new md5 sum stuff.

2005-08-02  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* doc/shar.1: split overlong line
	* doc/sharutils.texi: ditto
	* src/remsync.in($findtempfile): improve temp file usage
	* src/unshar.c(main): uninited variable
	* tests/shar-1(unshar): test basic functioning

	Thanks to: Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>

	* lib/inttostr.h(HAVE_INTMAX_T): if we don't, then typedef intmax_t
	into a long.  This is done in "configure" for uintmax_t, but the
	m4 macros for intmax_t do not create a substitute.  :(
	* lib/strtoimax.c(inttostr.h): include this header for that type.

2005-07-07  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* configure.ac, m4/sharutils.m4, Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.am:
	* src/Makefile.am: Some modernization.
	* configure.ac: Set AM_CONDITIONAL([UUCODE]) according to
	--disable-uucode.
	* src/Makefile.am: Use "if UUCODE".
	* doc/Makefile.am: Likewise.

2005-06-24  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* src/shar.c(shar): Do not use snprintf, either.  "True" unix doesn't
	have it, so pre-compute the maximum buffer size conceivable and
	allocate that size instead.  Also, only allocate the name buffer
	just once and reuse it.

2005-04-29  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* src/unshar.c(main): unlink the temporary file created when
	unsharing from stdin

2005-04-24  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am(DISTCLEANFILES): stamp-h is cleanable.
	(ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): specify the m4 macro subdirectory
	* src/unshar.c(load_stdin): newly extracted from main.
	Close a microscopic timing vulnerability, fix file name length
	"vulnerability" and remove size limit on same.
	* contrib/pas-diffs: this file was incomprehensible, unusable and
	diffed against a version more than a decade old.  Deleted.
	* contrib/Makefile.am: Removed from EXTRA_DIST.
	* m4/xstrtoimax.m4(jm_AC_TYPE_): these have acquired new prefix
	initials: gl instead of jm.

2005-01-30  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* bootstrap: new script replacing "autoreconf"
	* throughout: cleanups for newer versions of tools.

2005-01-23  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* tests/shar-1: modify to avoid changing for every release
	* tests/shar-1.ok: modify the sample output, too.
